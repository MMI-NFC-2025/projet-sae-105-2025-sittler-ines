  <p class="article-intro__text">
    Often confined to secondary roles, or even totally absent, women scientists have long been the great forgotten ones of literature. Yet, between clichés and exceptional figures, works of fiction say a lot about the perception of these pioneers. A literary journey that echoes Marie Meurdrac's struggle and the heroines of The Shadow Figures.

      Characters between stereotype and reality
    </h2>

    <p class="article__text">
      The woman of science is a rare character in literature. When she appears, she is often depicted as the eccentric old maid, the devoted assistant of a genius scientist, or the icy and inaccessible beauty. These caricatural representations reflect the prejudices of a society that has long struggled to conceive that a woman could combine scientific intelligence and "femininity".
    </p>

    <p class="article__text">
      Fortunately, some authors have managed to break these stereotypes to create complex and inspiring scientist characters. We think of the Marquise de Merteuil from Dangerous Liaisons, who, although not a scientist in the strict sense, uses ruthless rhetoric and logic. Closer to us, characters from science fiction novels or thrillers feature strong and independent women scientists, at the heart of the action and solving mysteries.

      The literary echo of the Matilda effect
    </h2>

    <p class="article__text">
      Literature, like history, has often been a victim of the "Matilda Effect". For one Marie Curie, erected as an icon, how many women scientists have been erased from narratives? Their discoveries attributed to men, their role minimized, their name forgotten.
    </p>

    <p class="article__text">
      The character of the woman scientist in literature is often the reflection of this invisibility. She is the one who works in the shadows, whose name does not appear on publications, the one who has to fight twice as hard to obtain recognition from her peers. In this, fiction joins the reality of women like Marie Meurdrac, who had to justify her legitimacy to write and teach chemistry, or like the NASA mathematicians, whose crucial role was long unrecognized.

      Render justice through words
    </h2>

    <p class="article__text">
      Fortunately, contemporary literature tends to repair these injustices. More and more novels and biographies highlight the paths of forgotten women scientists. These stories, often critical but always valorizing, allow to give back a voice and a face to these pioneers.
    </p>

    <p class="article__text">
      They show their determination, the obstacles they had to overcome, and the importance of their contribution to science. By telling their stories, literature does more than pay homage to individuals: it offers models to young generations and participates in the construction of a fairer and more egalitarian history of sciences. A fight that Marie Meurdrac, with her book "in favor of ladies", had already initiated more than three centuries ago.
